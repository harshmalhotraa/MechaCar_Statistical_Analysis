## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- vehicle length and ground clearence provided non-random amount of variance to mpg values.
- slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because p-value was significantly small.
- this linear model is good to predict mpg of MechaCars effectively because the R-squared value oobtained from this model is 0.7149, which ultimately is the definition of a strong correlation.
