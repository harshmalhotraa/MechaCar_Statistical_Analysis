## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Vehicle length and ground clearence provided non-random amount of variance to mpg values.
- Slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because p-value was significantly small.
- This linear model is good to predict mpg of MechaCars effectively because the R-squared value oobtained from this model is 0.7149, which ultimately is the definition of a strong correlation.
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- Screenshots are submitted above as files "totalsummary.PNG" and "lotsummary.PNG".
- According to design constraint, variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The summary for all manfucaturing lots in total and lots 1 and 2 individually do not exceed this constraint. However, lot 3 does not meet the design specification as the variance obtained from lot 3 is 170.29 which is significantly greater than maximum limit of 100 pounds per square inch.
